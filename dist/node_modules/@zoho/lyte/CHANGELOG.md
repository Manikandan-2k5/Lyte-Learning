    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       An action named 'onBeforeload' is provided for a route to notify routes before load state.
    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       Status code to determine a transition's state is provided in transition object.
    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       History details ( to provide details such as initial load, history Index and fromHistory - to specify if the transition is via history api / history buttons such as back/forward button) provided in router instance and beforeRouteTransition.

    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       Provision to maintain query params across transition (sticky query params - Note: This change is reverse of what is happening now. Say for example a filter param is specified as sticky, if the param is not sent the previously applied value will be used. In older implementation if a param is not sent we will discard the current value and set it to empty. )
    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       Provision to decide whether to refresh model on query param change.
    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       Inbuilt promise handling in route's model hooks. (Routes model hooks can return object with promises directly without using resolve promises).

    [ADDED]         [LYTE-ROUTER]       forceFetch as callback instead of property. This will help to determine a forceFetch is needed based on any specific check.
